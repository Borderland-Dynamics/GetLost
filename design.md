##### Story

Get Lost takes place in a low magic (utility, support, enhancement, healing, attack spells very very rare), steampunk world dominated by mice.  If you were to imagine a world with mice "of character" akin to Gangsters of New York amongst their other rodent characteristics.  They drink like dwarves and tinker like gnomes.  The infrastructure tends towards ramshackle and includes wooden rope bridges and other similar pathways for mouse travel.  There is an abundantance of trade, bartering, and boozing in the Get Lost world.  Mice in Get Lost love dancing to jazz and celebrating merrily.  

One day the player's character is strolling merrily with his fiance when suddenly a large bird swoops down from the sky and grabs your fiance!  As you see what is happening you rush to action and bite the bird's leg as it takes off.  The bird tries and tries to shake you off and it becomes increasingly difficult to hang on.  As you notice the bird descending towards a nest in the distance above a large complex square shaped structure it finally becomes too much to hold on as the bird makes once last desparate attempt to shake you.  You are shaken free and fall into "the maze."

The player must rush to the exit to rescue the one they love!
